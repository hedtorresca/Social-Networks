# Introduction

# Social Networks Analysis: Research Requirement

**Social networks** may signal **change** within an organization, and may even **predict** significant events or behaviors.

Detect these changes enables 

* the **anticipation** and early **warning** of change and
* faster **response** to change.

--

### _*Procedure*_

By applying **Statistical Process Control** techniques 
to social networks we can detect these changes.

# Organizations are not static

Their structure, composition, and patterns of communication may change **over time**.

--

A certain degree of change is expected in the **normal course** of an unchanging organization.

--

### _*The challenge*_
Develope metrics to detect **signals of meaningful change** in social networks in a background of normal variability.


---

# Social Network Change Detection

Previous methods may be effective at quantifying a difference in static networks, **but** they lack an underlying **statistical distribution**.

--

Now we want to improve significantly on previous attempts to detect organizational change over time.


--


### _*In what way?*_

By introducing a statistically sound **probability space** and uniformly more powerful **detection methods¨** we prevent an analyst from identifying a statiscally significant change.

--

We propose techniques from _*SNA**_, combined with those from _*SPC*_**.

#  Social Network Analysis

---

# Graphs


SNA provides the basis for how social networks are modeled, measured, compared and visualized.

--

+ An **observed social network** can be modeled on a graph with people represented as **vertices** and links between them as **edges**. [1] 

.footnote[[1] (Scott, 2002; Wasserman &amp; Faust, 1994) ]

--

+ Edges may be weighted to show the importance of the link or may be directed to show who is initiating the link and who is receiving it. 



---

# Centrality Network Measures

Network measures can be calculated from the entire graph (**extrinsic attributes**) or for each individual node (**intrinsic attributes**).

--
.pull-left[

**Density**

How many links exist in the graph divided by the total number of possible links.

$$ d = \frac{\text{# edges}}{n(n-1)}$$
--

**Closeness centrality**

How a node is connected beyond its immediate neighbors.

`$$c_k = \frac{\min_k\{\sum_{i=1}^n g_{ki}\}}{\sum_{i=1}^n g_{ki}}$$`

]

--

.pull-right[
**Betweenness centrality**

How often a node lies along the shortest path, or geodesic, between two other nodes for all nodes in a graph.

`$$b_k = \sum _{i,j} \frac{g_{ikj}}{g_{ij}}$$`
+ `\(g_{ikj}\)`: the number of geodesic paths between nodes i and j crossing node k.

+ `\(g_{ij}\)`: total number of geodesic paths between nodes i and j.

# Statistical Process Control

---

# Control charts

SPC is a technique used mostly to monitor industrial processes.

--

These detect changes in the **mean** of the process by taking periodic samples of the product and tracking the results against a **control limit**.

--

Control charts are usually optimized for their processes to increase their sensitivity for detecting changes, while minimizing the number of **false alarms**.

---
# CUSUM* Control Chart

The decision rule runs off the cumulative statistic

`$$C_t = \sum_{j=1}^t (Z_i - k)$$`

.footnote[[*] Cumulative Sum]

--

where `\(Z_i\)` is the standardized normal of each observation and the common choice for `\(k\)` is 0.5


--

This chart is well suited:

--
.pull-left[+ To detect small changes in the mean of a process over time.]

--

.pull-right[+ To found its built-in change point detection]

# Methods and Result

---
 
 # Graph mesures

The average graph measures for
**density**, **closeness**, and **betweenness centrality** are calculated for several consecutive time periods of the social network.

--

+ The **“in-control” mean and variance** for the measures of the network are calculated by taking a sample average and sample variance of the **stabilized measures**.

--


+ The subsequent, successive social network measures are then used to calculate the CUSUM’s statistics.

--


+ Upon receiving a signal, the *change point** is calculated by tracing the signaling `\(C^+\)` or `\(C^-\)` statistic back to the last time period it was zero.

---

#Network mesures

The network measures of interest should follow or approximate a normal distribution due to the central limit theorem.

--

Each of the network measures was fit with five continuous distributions: normal, uniform, gamma, exponential, and chi-squared.

--

### _*The Problem*_
Gamma Distribution is the best fit for betweenness and density network
measures. This invalidated further usage of the CUSUM Control
Chart.

---

# Tactical Officer Eduaction Program

The TOEP officers agreed to allow data about their personal and professional e-mail communication to be tracked over a 24-week period.

--

There were subjects with incomplete communication and not identically distributed data collected . These were eliminated from further examination.

&lt;/p&gt;

## Normally distributed but too much variance

The planning calendar, combined with participant interviews, allowed investigators to determine the number of significant events from a variety of categories that occurred each week: 

+ Academic Requirements
+ The Next Week’s Academic Requirements
+ Administrative Events
+ Group Projects + Social Gatherings
+ Days Off.

--

_*Analysis of variance (ANOVA)*_

`$$\text{Closeness} = 0.18 − 0.11(\text{Group Projects} ) + 0.11(\text{Social Gatherings}) + 0.0074(\text{Number of Emails})$$`
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
  &lt;img width="430" height="200" src="Captura2.PNG"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

---

##  Closeness CUSUM

When is the model no longer providing a good prediction?

--

The `\(C_+\)` and `\(C_-\)` statistics were calculated for each week using a `\(k\)` value of 0.5 and a control limit of 3.

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
  &lt;img width="600" height="300" src="Captura3.PNG"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

---

## Summary

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
  &lt;img width="560" height="300" src="Captura4.PNG"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
--

**Notices:**

+ An increase in group project work was correlated with a decrease in communication.

+ The residuals were verified as normally distributed to meet the prerequisites of the CUSUM Control Chart.

# Al-Qaeda Communications Network

The data are limited in that we do not know the type, frequency, or substance of the communication and all links are non-directional.

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
  &lt;img width="500" height="450" src="Captura5.PNG"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


---

## Averages for mesures

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
  &lt;img width="550" height="300" src="Captura6.PNG"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

--

**Notices**

+ There might be a significant change in the al-Qaeda network between the years 2000
and 2001. 

+ We would be alerted to a critical  change in the network prior to the September 11 terrorist attacks.

# Conclusions

---

# Discussion and further work

+ Social network
monitoring can to detect important changes in the monitored communication of both command and control networks as well as terrorist networks.

+ Several difficulties were encountered when working with the datasets, for example, the completeness of the dataset.

+ Future research should focus on near-complete datasets with high resolution.

+ Networks with a set of good
predictors to explain varying behavior may be useful in  producing models that can be control charted.
