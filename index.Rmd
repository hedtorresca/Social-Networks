# Introduction

# Social Networks Analysis 
## Research Requirement

### Detect these changes enables 

--
- ###  the **anticipation** and early **warning** of change and

--

- ###  **faster response** to change

# Organizations are not static
## The challenge

- ### Their structure, composition, and patterns of communication may change **over time**.

--

- ### A certain degree of change is expected in the **normal course** of an unchanging organization.

--

- ### Develope metrics to detect **signals of meaningful change** in a background of normal variability.


---

# Social Network Change Detection
## Overview
### Previous methods may be effective at quantifying a difference in static networks, **but** they lack an underlying **statistical distribution**.
 
 ### **Examples**
 
 - ### Hamming distance: Error detector and corrector codes
 - ### Euclidean distance: Weighted networks
 - ### Exponential Random Graph Models: Metrics and statistical models describe structural changes

---
# Social Network Change Detection
## Now and in what way?

--

### Improving significantly on previous attempts to detect organizational change **over time**.


--


### Introducing a statistically sound **probability space** and uniformly more powerful **detection methods¨** 

--

### Techniques from _*SNA*_, combined with those from _*SPC*_.

#  Social Network Analysis

# Graphs

--
### SNA provides the basis for how social networks are modeled, measured, compared and visualized.

+ ### An **observed social network** can be modeled on a graph with **nodes** and links between them as **edges**. [1]

# Network Measures

--
### Network measures can be calculated 

--
- ### **from the entire graph (_extrinsic attributes_) or **


--

- ### for each individual node (_intrinsic attributes_).

---
# Network Measures
## Extrinsic Attributes

### **Density**

### How many links exist in the graph divided by the total number of possible links.

$$ d = \frac{\text{# edges}}{n(n-1)}$$

# Density

# Centrality Network Measures
## Extrinsic Attributes

###**Closeness centrality**

### How a node is connected beyond its immediate neighbors.

$$c_k = \frac{\min_k\{\sum_{i=1}^n g_{ki}\}}{\sum_{i=1}^n g_{ki}}$$  
+ $g_{ik}$: the number of geodesic paths between nodes i and j.

# Centrality Network Measures
## Extrinsic Attributes

### **Betweenness centrality**

### How often a node lies along the shortest path, or geodesic, between two other nodes for all nodes in a graph.

$$b_k = \sum _{i,j} \frac{g_{ikj}}{g_{ij}}$$
+ $g_{ikj}$: the number of geodesic paths between nodes i and j crossing node k.

+ $g_{ij}$: total number of geodesic paths between nodes i and j.

# What is a Meta-Network?

+ ### **Meta-Network** – A representation of a Group of Networks.

--

+ ### **Node** – A representation of a real-world item (a who, what, where, how, why item).

--

+ ### **Node Class** – A set of nodes of one type.

--

+ ### **Link** – A representation of a tie, edge, connection, or relation link between any two nodes.

--

+ ### **Network** – A representation of a set of nodes of one type and the links of one type between them.

--

+ ### **Attribute** – Additional information about a node.

# Statistical Process Control

---

# Control charts

### SPC is a technique used mostly to monitor industrial processes.

--

### These detect changes in the **mean** of the process by taking periodic samples of the product and tracking the results against a **control limit**.

--

### Control charts are usually optimized for their processes to increase their sensitivity for detecting changes, while minimizing the number of **false alarms**.

---
# CUSUM* Control Chart

### The **decision rule** runs off the cumulative statistic

$$C_t = \sum_{j=1}^t (Z_i - k)$$

.footnote[[*] Cumulative Sum]

--

#### where $Z_i$ is the standardized normal of each observation and the common choice for $k$ is 0.5


--

### This chart is well suited:

--
+ ### To detect small changes in the mean of a process over time.

--

+ ### To found its built-in change point detection

# Methods and Result

---
 
 # Graph mesures

### The average graph measures for **density**, **closeness**, and **betweenness centrality** are calculated for several consecutive time periods of the social network.

--

+ ### The **“in-control” mean and variance** for the measures of the network are calculated by taking a sample average and sample variance of the **stabilized measures**.

--


+ ### The subsequent, successive social network measures are then used to calculate the CUSUM’s statistics.

--


+ ### Upon receiving a signal, the **change point** is calculated by tracing the signaling statistic back to the last time period it was zero.

---

# Network mesures

+ ### Network measures of interest should follow or approximate a **normal distribution** due to the central limit theorem.

--

+ ### Each of the network measures was fit with five **continuous distributions**: normal, uniform, gamma, exponential, and chi-squared.

--

+ ### **Gamma Distribution** is the best fit for betweenness and density. This invalidated further usage of the **CUSUM Control Chart**.

# Tactical Officer Eduaction Program

#### The TOEP officers allow data about their personal and professional e-mail communication to be tracked over a 24-week period.

--

#### Subjects with incomplete communication and not identically distributed data collected were eliminated from further examination.

# Normally distributed but too much variance

### The planning calendar and participant interviews allowed investigators significant events that occurred each week: 

+ #### Academic Requirements
+ #### The Next Week’s Academic Requirements
+ #### Administrative Events
+ #### Group Projects + Social Gatherings
+ #### Days Off.

---
# Normally distributed but too much variance
### **Analysis of variance (ANOVA)**

$$\text{Closeness} = 0.18 − 0.11(\text{Group Projects} ) + 0.11(\text{Social Gatherings}) + 0.0074(\text{Number of Emails})$$

##  Closeness CUSUM

#### When is the model no longer providing a good prediction?

--

#### The $C_+$ and $C_-$ statistics were calculated for each week using a $k$ value of 0.5 and a control limit of 3.

--

#### **Notices:**

+ #### An increase in group project work was **correlated** with a decrease in communication.

+ #### The **residuals** were verified as normally distributed to meet the prerequisites of the CUSUM Control Chart.

# Al-Qaeda Communications Network

#### The data are limited in that we do not know the type, frequency, or substance of the communication and all links are non-directional.

#### **Notices**

+ #### There might be a significant change in the al-Qaeda network between the years 2000 and 2001. 

+ #### We would be alerted to a critical  change in the network prior to the September 11 terrorist attacks.

# Conclusions

---

# Discussion and further work

+ ### Social network monitoring can to detect important changes in the monitored communication of both command and control networks as well as **terrorist networks**.

+ ### Several difficulties were encountered when working with the datasets, for example, the **completeness** of the dataset.

+ ### **Future research** should focus on near-complete datasets with high resolution.

+ ### Networks with a set of good predictors to explain varying behavior may be useful in  producing models that can be **control charted**.
