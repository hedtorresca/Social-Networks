# Social Networks Analysis: Research Requirement

Social networks may signal change within an
organization, and may even predict significant events or behaviors.

--

Detect these changes enables 

* the anticipation and early warning of change and
* faster response to change.

--

### _*Procedure:*_
By applying **Statistical Process Control** techniques 
to social networks we can detect these changes.

# Organizations are not static

Their structure, composition, and patterns of
communication may change over time.

--

A certain degree of change is expected in the normal course of an unchanging organization.

--

### _*The challenge:*_
Develope metrics to detect signals of meaningful change in social networks in a background of normal variability.


---
# Social Network Change Detection

Previous methods may be effective at quantifying a difference in static networks, **but** they lack an underlying statistical distribution.

--
Now we want to improve  significantly on previous attempts to detect organizational change over time.

--

### _*In what way?*_

By introducing a statistically sound probability space and uniformly more powerful detection methods we prevent an analyst from identifying a statiscally significant change.

--

We propose techniques from SNA [2], combined with those from statistical process control.

# remark.js vs xaringan

Some differences between using remark.js (left) and using **xaringan** (right):

.pull-left[
1. Start with a boilerplate HTML file;

1. Plain Markdown;

1. Write JavaScript to autoplay slides;

1. Manually configure MathJax;

1. Highlight code with `*`;

1. Edit Markdown source and refresh browser to see updated slides;
]

.pull-right[
1. Start with an R Markdown document;

1. R Markdown (can embed R/other code chunks);

1. Provide an option `autoplay`;

1. MathJax just works;<sup>*</sup>

1. Highlight code with `{{}}`;

1. The RStudio addin "Infinite Moon Reader" automatically refreshes slides on changes;

# Thanks!

Slides created via the R package [**xaringan**](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan).

The chakra comes from [remark.js](https://remarkjs.com), [**knitr**](http://yihui.name/knitr), and [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).
